Amazon RedShift 
fully managed, columnar cloud data warehouse.
It uses MPP massively parallel processing

### Amazon Kinesis
For streaming of data like click on mobile app where data comes every second .
It can be populated to amazon kinesis firehose o kinesis datastreams 
If it is simple then we need to populate to kinesis firehose.
to do some analystics before loading to storage we can use kinesis analytics.

Kinesis Data Firehose is ideal for ingesting data for storage.
It can also transform data using an AWS Lambda function before storing it.
Kinesis Data Firehose streams can only be associated with a single consumer, and the target must be Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, or Splunk.
Messaging services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) would be better suited for processing and responding to individual messages than processing a stream of data.
Kinesis Data Firehose has built-in retries. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams does not, but order is not guaranteed with Kinesis Data Firehose.
