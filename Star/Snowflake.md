### Star Schema	
pect	Star Schema	Snowflake Schema
Structure	Central fact table with denormalized dimension tables
Dimension Tables	Denormalized (flatter structure)
Complexity	Simpler design and relationships
Query Performance	Generally faster due to fewer joins
Data Redundancy	Higher, due to denormalization
Storage Requirements	Higher, due to redundancy	
### Snowflake Schema
Central fact table with normalized dimension tables
Normalized (more complex, hierarchical structure)
More complex design and relationships
May be slower due to more joins and complex queries
Data Redundancy	Lower, due to normalization
Lower, due to reduced redundancy


Kimball Methodology
Approach	Bottom-up
Data Modeling	Dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schemas)
Implementation	Start with data marts and integrate them
Centralized integration from the start
Speed to Value	Faster, with quicker delivery of business solutions
Scalability	Scalable through adding data marts
Complexity	Simpler and user-centric
Redundancy	Potential redundancy in data marts

### Inmon Methodology
Top-down
Normalized modeling
Start with a centralized EDW and build data marts later
Data Integration	Incremental integration with standardized dimensions	
Slower, due to comprehensive EDW setup first
Scalable through data marts based on centralized data
More complex, but centralized and consistent
Reduced redundancy through normalization
