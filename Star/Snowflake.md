### Star Schema	
pect	Star Schema	Snowflake Schema
Structure	Central fact table with denormalized dimension tables
Dimension Tables	Denormalized (flatter structure)
Complexity	Simpler design and relationships
Query Performance	Generally faster due to fewer joins
Data Redundancy	Higher, due to denormalization
Storage Requirements	Higher, due to redundancy	
### Snowflake Schema
Central fact table with normalized dimension tables
Normalized (more complex, hierarchical structure)
More complex design and relationships
May be slower due to more joins and complex queries
Data Redundancy	Lower, due to normalization
Lower, due to reduced redundancy
